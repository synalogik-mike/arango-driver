Title: aRangodb
Description: The aRangodb package is a library that allows the user
             to connect, interacts and query an Arango database. The
             Arango Server manages a NoSQL multi-model database. In particular it
             combines the power of documents and key-value data with
             the ability to model such data into graphs. Relations are then
             exploited as edges connecting related data. The package also
             implement some visualization functions to support the analysis
             of data structured in this way. See the aRangodb website for more information, 
             documentation and examples.
